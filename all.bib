@article{masoud2020a,
	abstract = {The overarching goal of this work is to develop an accurate, robust, and stable methodology for finite deformation modeling using strong-form peridynamics (PD) and the correspondence modeling framework. We adopt recently developed methods that make use of higher-order corrections to improve the computation of integrals in the correspondence formulation. A unified approach is presented that incorporates the reproducing kernel (RK) and generalized moving least square (GMLS) approximations in PD to obtain non-local gradients of higher-order accuracy. We show, however, that the improved quadrature rule does not suffice to handle instability issues that have proven problematic for the correspondence model-based PD. In Part I of this paper, a bond-associative, higher-order core formulation is developed that naturally provides stability without introducing artificial stabilization parameters. Numerical examples are provided to study the convergence of RK-PD, GMLS-PD, and their bond-associated versions to a local counterpart, as the degree of non-locality (i.e., the horizon) approaches zero. Problems from linear elastostatics are utilized to verify the accuracy and stability of our approach. It is shown that the bond-associative approach improves the robustness of RK-PD and GMLS-PD formulations, which is essential for practical applications. The higher-order, bond-associated model can obtain second-order convergence for smooth problems and first-order convergence for problems involving field discontinuities, such as curvilinear free surfaces. In Part II of this paper, we use our unified PD framework to (a) study wave propagation phenomena, which have proven problematic for the state-based correspondence PD framework, and (b) propose a new methodology to enforce natural boundary conditions in correspondence PD formulations, which should be particularly appealing to coupled problems. Our results indicate that bond-associative methods accompanied by higher-order gradient corrections provide the key ingredients to obtain the necessary accuracy, stability, and robustness characteristics needed for engineering-scale simulations.},

	abstract = {A class of peridynamic material models known as constitutive correspondence models provide a bridge between classical continuum mechanics and peridynamics. These models are useful because they allow well-established local constitutive theories to be used within the nonlocal framework of peridynamics. A recent finite deformation correspondence theory (Foster and Xu, 2018) was developed and reported to improve stability properties of the original correspondence model (Silling et al., 2007). This paper presents a stability analysis that indicates the reported advantages of the new theory were overestimated. Homogeneous deformations are analyzed and shown to exibit unstable material behavior at the continuum level. Additionally, the effects of a particle discretization on the stability of the model are reported. Numerical examples demonstrate the large errors induced by the unstable behavior. Stabilization strategies and practical applications of the new finite deformation model are discussed.},

@article{Kramer2019,
	abstract = {The Sandia Fracture Challenges provide a forum for the mechanics community to assess its ability to predict ductile fracture through a blind, round-robin format where mechanicians are challenged to predict the deformation and failure of an arbitrary geometry given experimental calibration data. The Third Challenge (SFC3) required participants to predict fracture in an additively manufactured (AM) 316L stainless steel bar containing through holes and internal cavities that could not have been conventionally machined. The volunteer participants were provided extensive data including tension and notched tensions tests of 316L specimens built on the same build-plate as the Challenge geometry, micro-CT scans of the Challenge specimens and geometric measurements of the feature based on the scans, electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) information on grain texture, and post-test fractography of the calibration specimens. Surprisingly, the global behavior of the SFC3 geometry specimens had modest variability despite being made of AM metal, with all of the SFC3 geometry specimens failing under the same failure mode. This is attributed to the large stress concentrations from the holes overwhelming the stochastic local influence of the AM voids and surface roughness. The teams were asked to predict a number of quantities of interest in the response based on global and local measures that were compared to experimental data, based partly on Digital Image Correlation (DIC) measurements of surface displacements and strains, including predictions of variability in the resulting fracture response, as the basis for assessment of the predictive capabilities of the modeling and simulation strategies. Twenty-one teams submitted predictions obtained from a variety of methods: the finite element method (FEM) or the mesh-free, peridynamic method; solvers with explicit time integration, implicit time integration, or quasi-statics; fracture methods including element deletion, peridynamics with bond damage, XFEM, damage (stiffness degradation), and adaptive remeshing. These predictions utilized many different material models: plasticity models including J2 plasticity or Hill yield with isotropic hardening, mixed Swift-Voce hardening, kinematic hardening, or custom hardening curves; fracture criteria including GTN model, Hosford-Coulomb, triaxiality-dependent strain, critical fracture energy, damage-based model, critical void volume fraction, and Johnson-Cook model; and damage evolution models including damage accumulation and evolution, crack band model, fracture energy, displacement value threshold, incremental stress triaxiality, Cocks-Ashby void growth, and void nucleation, growth, and coalescence. Teams used various combinations of calibration data from tensile specimens, the notched tensile specimens, and literature data. A detailed comparison of results based of these different methods is presented in this paper to suggest a set of best practices for modeling ductile fracture in situations like the SFC3 AM-material problem. All blind predictions identified the nominal crack path and initiation location correctly. The SFC3 participants generally fared better in their global predictions of deformation and failure than the participants in the previous Challenges, suggesting the relative maturity of the models used and adoption of best practices from previous Challenges. This paper provides detailed analyses of the results, including discussion of the utility of the provided data, challenges of the experimental-numerical comparison, defects in the AM material, and human factors.},

	abstract = {In the context of the third Sandia Fracture Challenge (SFC3), the details of the blind predictions performed by the University of Texas team are provided in this article. Over the past two decades, the peridynamic theory has shown great promise in modeling autonomous crack nucleation and growth in materials. While peridynamics has been commonly applied to simulate failure of brittle materials, its ability in predicting ductile fracture has remained mostly untested. This fracture challenge was seen as an opportunity to assess the state of the art of the peridynamic theory in predicting the response of an additively manufactured 316L stainless steel bar with a complex geometry under the dynamic tensile experiments performed by Sandia National Laboratories. The performance of a recently proposed, generalized, ordinary finite deformation constitutive correspondence model, coupled with a recent state-based damage correspondence model was explored over this problem. For finite deformation material modeling, the classical elastoplastic framework of Simo was implemented within the ordinary correspondence theory. Damage modeling was achieved by incorporating the Johnson-Cook failure criterion using the damage correspondence framework. An iterative inverse technique was applied to calibrate the model parameters using the longitudinal and notched tensile tests data provided by Sandia National Laboratories. A blind prediction of the deformation and failure behavior of the SFC3 geometry was performed by embedding the calibrated model in a peridynamic simulation. Uncertainty was introduced into the model parameters to quantify material variability. The results are compared to the experiments conducted at Sandia National Laboratories. While our modeling approach led to qualitatively good results and a correctly predicted crack path, it underpredicted the load-carrying capacity of the structure and simulated an early fracture. Our post-experiment analysis identifies material instability issues associated with the model as the primary sources of error.},

In particular, we introduce a state-based nonlocal friction formulation that corrects for loss of angular momentum balance and objectivity in a widely used frictional extension of short-range contact forces. We demonstrate the properties of various peridynamic contact models by applying them in finite element and meshfree peridynamic analyses of benchmark problems and an impact/penetration test.},

@article{Behzadinasab2018,
	abstract = {The shock wave perturbation decay experiment is a technique in which the evolution of a perturbation in a shock wave front is monitored as it propagates through a material field. This tool has recently been explored to probe the high-rate shear response of granular materials. This dynamic behavior is complicated due to inter- and intra-granular phenomena involved. Mesoscale modeling can give insight into this complexity by explicitly resolving the interactions and deformation of individual grains. The peridynamic theory, which is a nonlocal continuum theory, provides a suitable framework for modeling dynamic problems involving fracture. Prior research has focused mostly on the continuum, bulk response, neglecting any localized material failure, of granular materials. A systematic investigation of the effects of grain fracture and frictional contact forces between grains on the continuum behavior of granular materials is carried out by peridynamic simulations of a shock wave perturbation decay experiment. A sensitivity assessment of dominant factors indicates that grain fracture, a phenomenon ignored in most computational investigations of granular materials, plays a large role in the bulk dynamic response. Our results show that the wave propagates faster with an increase in the toughness of the material and the inter-particle friction. Also, the shock amplitude is shown to decay faster in tougher materials. It is further confirmed that under strong compression self-contact among fractured grain sub-particles cannot be neglected.},

	abstract = {AbstractHydrocarbon extraction from unconventional oil and gas reservoirs requires more accurate ways to describe fracture processes in shale. Fracture initiation, propagation and coalescence has been studied in many rock-like materials {$[$}1,2{$]$} and natural rocks {$[$}1,2,3{$]$} . However, shale is typically heterogeneous and anisotropic with naturally formed bedding planes. Natural bedding planes can be weak zones where fractures can initiate and propagate along {$[$}1, 2, 3{$]$}. A series of unconfined compression tests were conducted on Opalinus clay shale with two pre-existing flaws and various bedding plane orientations (0, 30, 60, and 90 degrees with respect to the horizontal). High speed and high resolution imagery were use to capture fracture initiation, propagation and coalescence between the flaw pairs. Distinct coalescence and cracking patterns were observed when compared to previously tested rocks. As the bedding angle increased, fractures initiating at the flaw tips tended to propagate more frequently along the bedding planes. Coalescence of cracks between flaws trended from direct-combined (tensile and shear cracks) to indirect as the bedding plane angle increased. Tensile crack initiation and coalescence stresses showed a characteristic U-shape profile with a minimum at 60 degree bedding plane orientation and a maximum at 0 degree bedding plane orientation.},

@article{ouchi2017a,
	abstract = {Summary A novel and fully coupled hydraulic-fracturing model derived from a nonlocal continuum theory of peridynamics is presented and applied to the hydraulic-fracture (HF) propagation problem. It is shown that this modeling approach provides an alternative to finite-element and finite-volume methods for solving poroelastic and fracture-propagation problems. In this paper, we specifically investigate the interaction between an HF and natural fractures (NFs). The peridynamics model presented here allows us to simulate the propagation of multiple, nonplanar, interacting fractures and provides a novel approach to simulate the interaction between HFs and NFs. The model predictions in two dimensions have been validated by reproducing published experimental results where the interaction between an HF and an NF is controlled by the principal-stress contrast and the approach angle. A detailed parametric study involving poroelasticity and mechanical properties of the rock is performed to understand why an HF becomes arrested or crosses an NF. This analysis reveals that poroelasticity, resulting from high fracture-fluid leakoff, has a dominant influence on the interaction between an HF and an NF. In addition, the fracture toughness of the rock, the toughness of the NF, and the shear strength of the NF also affect the interaction between an HF and an NF. We also investigate the interaction of multiple completing fractures with NFs in two dimensions and demonstrate the applicability of the approach to simulate complex fracture networks on a field scale. Finally, the 3D interaction study elucidated that the height of the NF, the position of the NF, and the opening resistance of the NF all have a significant effect on the 3D interaction between an HF and an NF.},

	abstract = {Abstract The effect of different types of vertical reservoir heterogeneities on fracture propagation was systematically investigated. A fully 3-D, poroelastic model that does not prescribe the crack propagation path is used to estimate the fracture geometry in vertically heterogeneous rocks. Complex fracture trajectories are shown to occur and this limits fracture height growth. It is shown that the presence of bedding planes, layer interfaces and even smaller scale heterogeneities can lead to fracture turning, kinking or branching. The mechanisms that control these characteristic fracture propagation behaviors (``turning'', ``kinking'', and ``branching'') near the layer interface are explored in detail. In layered systems, the mechanical property contrast between layers, the dip angle, the stress contrast and the mechanical properties of the layer interface all play an important role in controlling the fracture trajectory. Conditions under which each type of behavior is expected to occur are clearly delineated. },

@conference{Ouchi2017,
	abstract = {Abstract Most hydraulic fracturing models assume that the rock is homogeneous at a pore scale. However, reservoirs are highly heterogeneous at all length scales. Pore scale heterogeneity is evident from thin sections and scanning electron microscopic images (SEM). Heterogeneity at larger length scales is evident from logs and cores. In this paper, the effect of micro-scale (pore and core scale) heterogeneities caused by varying mineral composition and the presence of pores and microfractures, on fracture propagation has been investigated. A model that solves the solid displacements and fluid pressures both inside and outside the fracture and allows for the creation and propagation of multiple fractures is presented. This peridynamics-based hydraulic fracturing model is used to model the growth of multiple, complex fractures in a heterogeneous rock. Thin section and SEM images of rocks are used to represent the geometry of the rock grains and the pores in several rock samples. Far-field stresses are then applied and a fluid induced fracture is propagated in the rock matrix. The results of the model reveal that the stress distribution and the fracture geometry can be quite complex at the micro-scale. Fracture branching and turning is induced by variations in elastic moduli and stress concentration at the grain scale. The microstructure of the fracture is, therefore, determined by the geometry and distribution of mineral grains, their mechanical properties, and the initial stress anisotropy due to the co-existence of different mineral grains. A similar effect is observed at the core scale where differences in the microstructure of the rock can result in stress concentration at layer boundaries. For example, we show that the presence of a brittle mineral like calcite in the rock matrix causes fractures to branch at the mineral interface. Multiple fractures are shown to open, some that may not be in hydraulic contact with each other. As the fracture propagation continues, only the least tortuous path remains open. All other branches are bypassed hydraulically and are eventually closed. This fracture complexity occurs despite macroscopic stress anisotropy. Several examples of fracture propagation in rocks that are heterogeneous at a pore scale are provided to show that such fracture complexity should be expected in most lithologies. These results clearly show that while we have traditionally represented fractures as planes perpendicular to the minimum horizontal stress, the fracture surfaces may indeed be much more complex due to existence of different minerals grains with widely different mechanical properties. Cracks can form away from the crack tip along planes of weakness. These damage zones resulting from strains induced by fracture propagation may explain the creation of the stimulated reservoir volume (regions of enhanced permeability) around fractures in shale reservoirs.},

@article{Rahman2015b,
	abstract = {Abstract In this work an effective method was proposed in order to resolve the wave reflection problems between local/nonlocal models as well as multiple nonlocal models with varying nonlocality. Spurious wave reflection has been a primary concern in developing a robust multiscale-multiresolution model. In the current work a power-law based nonlocal peridynamic model has been proposed in order to mitigate this issue in a versatile manner. The fractional power-law eliminates the spurious wave reflection at the interfaces between local/nonlocal regions or regions with different nonlocalities. By controlling the exponent of the power-law it is possible to vary the frequency components of short or long waves without requiring a large handshake region. Using this underlying idea, 1 | x − x ′ | 1 + α , ∀ 0 &lt; α &lt; 2 can be used as a kernel function in order to define nonlocal interaction between x and x′. It was shown that by controlling α it is possible to change the nature of nonlocal interaction within any given cutoff range. Besides power law, Gaussian kernel is another good choice in minimizing the wave reflection issue. However, Gaussian function has some limitations with large variation in nonlocality or waves with higher frequency. In that context the proposed model demonstrated it's effectiveness by removing any spurious wave reflections originated in various cases. },

@article{trilinos,
	abstract = {The Trilinos Project is an effort to facilitate the design, development, integration and ongoing support of mathematical software libraries within an object-oriented framework for the solution of large-scale, complex multi-physics engineering and scienti c problems. Trilinos addresses two fundamental issues of developing software for these problems: (i) Providing a streamlined process and set of tools for development of new algorithmic implementations and (ii) promoting interoperability of independently developed software.
\par Trilinos uses a two-level software structure designed around collections of packages. A Trilinos package is an integral unit usually developed by a small team of experts in a particular algorithms area such as algebraic preconditioners, nonlinear solvers, etc. Packages exist underneath the Trilinos top level, which provides a common look-and-feel, including configuration, documentation, licensing, and bug-tracking.
\par Here we present the overall Trilinos design, describing our use of abstract interfaces and default concrete implementations. We discuss the services that Trilinos provides to a prospective package and how these services are used by various packages. We also illustrate how packages can be combined to rapidly develop new algorithms. Finally, we discuss how Trilinos facilitates highquality software engineering practices that are increasingly required from simulation software.},
